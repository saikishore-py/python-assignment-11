#difference between list, tuoles and dictionary.


A list can store a sequence of objects in a certain order such that you can index into the list, or iterate over the list. List is a mutable type meaning that lists can
be modified after they have been created.

A tuple is similar to a list except it is immutable. There is also a semantic difference between a list and a tuple.
Tuples have structure, lists have order.

A dictionary is a key-value store. It is not ordered and it requires that the keys are hashable. It is fast for lookups by key.
